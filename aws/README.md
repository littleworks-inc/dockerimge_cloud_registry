Below is a sample README file that provides an overview of the Dockerfile and instructions on how to build the Docker image and test it:

---

# Docker Image: devtoolhub/aws_cli

## Overview

This Docker image provides an environment with Python 3, aws-cli, jq, git, and yq installed. It is designed to offer a convenient platform for working with AWS CLI commands and manipulating YAML files using yq.

## Dockerfile

The Dockerfile used to build this image installs the necessary packages using the Alpine package manager (`apk`). It also upgrades pip and installs yq from its GitHub release.

```Dockerfile
# Use the latest Alpine Linux base image
FROM alpine:latest

# Install necessary packages: Python 3, pip, awscli, jq, git
RUN apk --no-cache add \
        python3 \
        py3-pip \
        aws-cli \
        jq \
        git \
    # Upgrade pip
    && pip3 install --upgrade pip \
    # Install yq (YAML processor)
    && wget -q -O /usr/bin/yq $(wget -q -O - https://api.github.com/repos/mikefarah/yq/releases/latest | jq -r '.assets[] | select(.name == "yq_linux_amd64") | .browser_download_url') \
    && chmod +x /usr/bin/yq \
    # Remove unnecessary files
    && rm -rf /var/cache/apk/*
```

## Building the Docker Image

To build the Docker image, navigate to the directory containing the Dockerfile and execute the following command:

```bash
docker build -t devtoolhub/aws_cli .
```

## Testing the Docker Image

To test the Docker image and verify if all the required packages are installed, run a container based on the image and execute verification commands inside the container:

```bash
docker run -it --rm devtoolhub/aws_cli /bin/sh
```

Inside the container, you can execute commands such as `python3 --version`, `aws --version`, `jq --version`, `git --version`, and `yq --version` to verify the presence of the required packages.

Once you've finished testing, you can exit the container by typing `exit`.
